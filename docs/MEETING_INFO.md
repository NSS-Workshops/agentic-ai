# Let's Get Started

Tonight we begin your journey to learn the fundamentals of working with LLMs using an agent workflow in your IDE.

## Course Content

Here is the course content you will be using: https://nss-workshops.github.io/agentic-ai/introduction

It would be fantastic if you could read the Understanding LLMs chapter before we start so that we can discuss and I can field any questions.

## Rules of Engagement

- During the meeting, your camera is expected to be on at all times. 
- Your participation and engagement are expected at all times. This is not a workshop for the passive, as you will be actively learning at all times—just like you did at NSS. You aren't attending to be taught, you are attending to actively learn.
