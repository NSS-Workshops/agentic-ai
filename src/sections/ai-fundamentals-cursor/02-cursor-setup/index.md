## What is Cursor IDE?

Cursor is a modern code editor built specifically for AI-assisted development. Think of it as VS Code's AI-powered cousin—it looks and feels familiar but comes with powerful AI features built right in.

Unlike traditional code editors where AI is an add-on, Cursor was designed from the ground up to seamlessly integrate AI assistance into your coding workflow.

### Why Cursor for This Workshop?

Cursor is an ideal choice for people new to learning AI-assisted development because it removes the typical barriers that prevents many from getting started. The platform offers a generous free tier with GPT-4.1 access, meaning you can begin experimenting with advanced AI features immediately without needing API keys, subscriptions, or complex setup procedures. Since Cursor is built on the same foundation as VS Code, you'll find yourself in a familiar environment that minimizes the learning curve while maximizing your ability to focus on AI concepts rather than wrestling with a new interface. The editor provides multiple AI interaction modes—including chat, inline suggestions, and intelligent code completion—all integrated seamlessly into a professional-grade development environment that mirrors what you'll use in real-world projects.

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Download Cursor

1. Visit [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)
2. Click **"Download for [Your OS]"**
3. Install like any other application

### Step 2: Clone First Workshop Project

In your terminal, make a new directory in your home directory for this workshop.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/agentic-ai-workshop
```

Then navigate to that directory

```sh
cd ~/agentic-ai-workshop
```

Clone the **Coins-R-Us** project and `cd` to that directory

```sh
git clone git@github.com:NSS-Workshops/coins-r-us.git
cd coins-r-us
```

Then open the project in Cursor

```sh
cursor .
```

### Step 3: Initial Setup

When you first open Cursor:

1. **Sign up for an account** - This enables the free AI features
2. **Choose your theme** - Light, dark, or system preference

### Step 4: Activate Free Models

1. From the app menu at the top, choose **Cursor** -> **Settings** -> **Cursor Settings**
2. Click on **Models**
3. Search "gemini" and enable **gemini-2.5-flash**
4. Search "super" and enable **code-supernova-1-million**
5. Search "gpt" and enable **gpt-4.1**

You will start with using the **gpt-4.1** LLM. The other two require you to generate an API on their respective platforms, which you will do in a future session. As always, the curious are encouraged to use Google to figure this out on their own if they want to enable them now.

If this works, you're ready to go!

## Understanding Cursor's AI Features

### 1. Chat Interface (`Cmd+L` / `Ctrl+L`)

The **Chat** feature transforms your coding experience by providing an intelligent conversation partner that understands your development context. You can engage with this AI assistant to ask detailed questions about your code's functionality, request clear explanations of complex functions that might be difficult to understand, seek debugging assistance when errors arise, and collaboratively brainstorm creative solutions to challenging programming problems. This conversational approach makes learning more interactive and helps you develop a deeper understanding of both your code and programming concepts in general.

**Example Chat Prompts:**
```
"Explain what this function does"
"How can I optimize this code?"
"What's causing this error?"
"Show me a better way to write this"
```

### 2. Inline AI (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`)

**Inline AI** revolutionizes how you write and modify code by allowing you to generate or transform code directly within your editor through natural language instructions. This powerful feature enables you to describe what you want in plain English and watch as new code materializes based on your specifications, refactor existing code blocks with targeted improvements, automatically add comprehensive comments and documentation to make your code more maintainable, and apply precise bug fixes without manually hunting through complex logic. The inline approach keeps you in your coding flow while providing AI assistance exactly where and when you need it.

**Example Inline Prompts:**
```
"Create a function that validates email addresses"
"Add error handling to this function"
"Convert this to use async/await"
"Add TypeScript types to this code"
```

### 3. Tab Completion

As you type, Cursor's intelligent tab completion system anticipates your coding intentions and offers contextually relevant suggestions that go far beyond simple autocomplete. The system provides smart suggestions that understand not just the immediate code you're writing, but the broader context of your project, including variable names, function signatures, and established patterns throughout your codebase.

When working with complex programming patterns, Cursor can suggest entire multi-line code blocks that follow best practices and maintain consistency with your existing code style. Simply press Tab to accept these AI-powered suggestions and watch your coding speed increase dramatically while maintaining high code quality.

### 4. Code Selection Features

Cursor's code selection features provide targeted AI assistance for specific portions of your codebase, making it easy to get help with exactly the code you're working on.

When you select any block of code, you can right-click and choose **"Ask Cursor"** to receive detailed explanations of what the code does or get suggestions for improvements, use convenient keyboard shortcuts to trigger quick AI actions without interrupting your workflow, automatically generate comprehensive test cases for selected functions to improve your code's reliability, and apply intelligent refactoring suggestions that enhance code structure while preserving functionality.

This selection-based approach ensures that AI assistance remains focused and relevant to your immediate needs.

## Cost Considerations and Limits

### Free Tier Limits

Cursor's free tier provides a carefully balanced offering that supports serious learning while maintaining sustainable service quality. The platform includes limited monthly usage that proves generous enough for educational purposes and skill development, though it's designed to encourage thoughtful use rather than unlimited experimentation.

You'll have full access to GPT-4.1, ensuring that your AI interactions benefit from the most advanced language model capabilities available, delivering high-quality responses that can genuinely accelerate your learning.

Most importantly, the free tier doesn't restrict access to core features—you'll have complete access to chat functionality, inline AI assistance, and intelligent code completions, giving you the full Cursor experience without financial barriers.

### Usage Tips to Stay Within Limits

To maximize your free tier benefits and develop good AI-assisted coding habits, focus on crafting specific, detailed prompts that communicate your needs clearly in a single interaction, avoiding lengthy back-and-forth conversations that consume your quota unnecessarily.

Exercise thoughtful judgment with code completions by evaluating each suggestion rather than automatically accepting every AI recommendation, ensuring that accepted code aligns with your project's goals and coding standards. Prioritize using AI as a learning accelerator rather than a code generator—ask for explanations, request alternative approaches, and seek to understand the reasoning behind AI suggestions so you develop genuine programming skills alongside AI proficiency.

### When You Hit Limits

If you exceed the free tier:

- **Wait for reset** - Limits refresh monthly
- **Upgrade to Pro** - For unlimited usage. This will cost you, so only do this if you're willing to pay for Cursor.

## Your First AI-Assisted Coding Session
